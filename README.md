# Polar SDK

Polar SDK contains Android projects related to the Polar BLE SDK located at https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk.

These projects vary from demos and examples in their repository with few changes to ones with more enhancements to more developed applications using the SDK.  It could be viewed as a sandbox. The main projects are:

* PolarSDK-ECG-HR-Demo
    * An improved version of the demo in the SDK.  At one time it _was_ the demo in the SDK.  It would probably be better to use the current demo in the SDK, however.
* Polar HR Compare
    * Compares two devices for HR and RR or PP (depending on what they support).  It can be used to compare the Polar H10 and Polar OH1, for example.  You can use non-Polar devices by entering their MAC address for the ID.
* Polar ECG
    * Does an ECG for the Polar H10.  This is the original version, which works well, but the latest version is at https://github.com/KennethEvans/KE.Net-ECG.
